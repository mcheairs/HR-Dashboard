Business Travel Impact: Employees who travel frequently show lower attrition rates (8%) compared to non-traveling employees (20%).


Key Insights and Recommendations:
1.	Attrition in Sales: Sales roles have high attrition rates, which may be due to lower job satisfaction (2.48/4) and higher overtime (79%). Improving work conditions, providing better support, and possibly offering flexible hours or higher compensation may reduce attrition.
2.	Job Satisfaction: A clear correlation exists between higher job satisfaction and lower attrition. Offering more development opportunities and recognizing employee achievements could improve satisfaction, especially in departments like Sales and Laboratory Technicians, where satisfaction is low.
3.	Age and Work-Life Balance: Younger employees (18-25) and those with poor work-life balance are more likely to leave. Offering mentoring programs for younger employees and promoting work-life balance initiatives could help retain talent.
4.	Gender Attrition Disparity: Though male employees exhibit slightly higher attrition, the gap is small. However, HR departments may focus on retaining both genders equally by creating inclusive policies that address unique challenges.
5.	Impact of Education: The attrition rate may vary across different educational backgrounds. Companies could target specific education fields with retention programs, such as offering continuous learning opportunities or career growth for employees in high-attrition departments.
